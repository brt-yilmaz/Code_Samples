[From Uxcel](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/loginsignup-best-practices-854?utm_source=share-lesson)

Don't make users navigate to a new page to sign up when you can embed the form in their current page.

Make sure users understand how to switch between pages. Place the Don't have an account? Sign Up text below the form, so it's easy to spot but doesn't steal users' attention from the main content.

Sometimes we accidentally click “Sign Up” when we meant to log in, and vice versa. Make sure the forms link to one another so that it’s easy for users to switch to the other function if they make a mistake.

Make it easy for users to choose a password that meets those requirements by including a checklist right under the input and ticking them as users fulfill each one.

Social login drastically speeds up the registration process and greatly reduces the risk that they’ll forget their login information when returning to your site. When using social logins, use the buttons and brand colors of the platforms they’re integrated with

You need to give users a compelling reason to sign up for your product.

Put the buttons for them in a highly visible spot, such as the site’s header.

The main brand color can come in handy here to draw users' attention to the Log In and Sign Up buttons.

Use “log in” and “sign up” (or “register”) to make each action recognizable at a glance.

Be sure to use button hierarchy to distinguish between the two on your login and signup forms

Allowing users multiple options to log in can save a lot of frustration.

Add the option to show a password so that users can make sure they typed what they meant to.Always hide the password by default.

Put stay logged in option.On sites where staying logged in could be a security issue (such as banking websites), allow users to at least have their username remembered to speed up the login process. When security is a major priority, obscuring part of the username with asterisks makes the login process faster while also protecting users.

Apply autofocus to it to show your users where to start.

While designing signup forms for mobile devices, always think of keyboard placement
