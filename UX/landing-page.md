# Landing Page

Don't overload landing pages with text

Stick to clear, concise headlines that are relevant to the central content and demand attention. Shorter is generally better in this case.

Consider combining a header, description, and video on your landing page to best convey your value proposition.

Clarity is key when it comes to landing page copy. By using technical jargon and complex vocabulary to impress readers, you sacrifice readability and credibility.

You might even consider using a contrasting color outside of your landing page’s color palette for even better results.

CTAs should be immediately and clearly visible, without requiring users to scroll.

Make your call-to-action label clear

Use a large call-to-action button.The minimum touch target should be 9 by 9 mm (approximately 48dp) according to WCAG 2.0 recommendations.

When using text over media, the color contrast ratio should be 4.5:1 to comply with the WCAG 2.0 recommendations.

If there’s content below the cut that isn’t immediately apparent across devices and screen sizes, use a visual indicator to let users know it’s there.

Use contextual images

Creating urgency, though, can trigger them to take action quickly.

Social proof offers strong reassurance for people considering making a purchase. Including reviews, ratings, stats, and other social proof on your landing page can greatly persuade many consumers. In fact, 91% of consumers find a product more trustworthy if they get recommendations from people they know.

Use scarcity to trigger action

Brand authority builds trust

Use reciprocity to trigger action. Free shipping, discounts, special deals, and so on are all examples of reciprocity.

Make it easy for users to ask those questions by including a visible chat widget to convert prospects more quickly.

A word of caution here: sticky chat elements should be desktop features only.
